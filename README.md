## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. The robot receives commands via **Bluetooth** from a smartphone app.  
2. It drives forward, backward, left, or right based on user input.  
3. The **ultrasonic sensor** monitors front distance. If an obstacle is too close, the car **automatically stops**.  
4. The **IR sensor** monitors rear objects while reversing and makes the backlight blink faster.  
5. A **buzzer horn pattern** is activated via a command for alerts.  
6. **LED headlights and backlights** simulate a realistic car look.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. **Assemble the robot** as per wiring diagram.  
2. Install the **Arduino IDE** and upload `smart_bluetooth_robot_car.ino` to your board.  
3. Pair your phone with the **HC-05 Bluetooth module** (default password: `1234` or `0000`).  
4. Install a Bluetooth terminal app (like *Arduino Bluetooth Controller*).  
5. Send commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, etc.) to control the robot.  
6. Test ultrasonic stop and IR reverse alert features.
